# ft_ls
"As simple as listing files in a directory"

For this assignment, I am challenged to re-code the command line tool "ls", which lists files and directories within a directory. As the tool has many, many parameters, we are only required to code a couple of them. 

To use my program, simply clone the repository, and then make to compile. 

Usage:
	```./ft_ls [-larRt] [file_names ...]```

Requirements:

	Re-code ls. Must implement these parameters:

		-l 	long format
		-a	inlude hidden directories (any beginning with '.')
		-r	reverse the output order
		-R	Recursively list subdirectories encountered.
		-t	Sort by time modified (most recently modified first) before sorting the operands by lexicographical order.
		
Bonus requirements: 
	
	to come....



my program uses linked lists and mergesort to sort the lists.
